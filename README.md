# Mean, Median, Mode Calculator

This repository contains a simple yet effective Python algorithm for calculating basic statistical measures: **mean**, **median**, and **mode**. These functions are essential tools for any data analysis task, providing insight into the central tendency of a dataset.

## Functions Overview

- **`mean(list_of_nums)`**: Calculates the arithmetic mean (average) of a list of numbers.
- **`mode(list_of_nums)`**: Identifies the mode, or the most frequent number in a list.
- **`median(list_of_nums)`**: Determines the median, which is the middle value when the list is sorted.

## Usage

Here's how you can use the functions in your code:

```python
from mean_median_mode import mean, mode, median

data = [13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 16, 18]

print("Mean:", mean(data))
print("Mode:", mode(data))
print("Median:", median(data))
```

## Example Data

To see these functions in action, check out the examples_data.py file in this repository. It provides sample datasets and demonstrates how to apply the functions.

## Installation

To use this module, simply clone the repository and import the functions into your Python scripts:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mean-Med-Mode_Calculator.git
cd Mean-Med-Mode_Calculator
```
